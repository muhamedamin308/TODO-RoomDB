# Libraries and technologies used
### UI Layer
- view binding : instead of inflating views manually view binding will take care of that.
- Navigation Fragments : to navigate between the screens.
### Logic Layer
- MVVM & LiveData : Saperate logic code from views and save the state in case the screen configuration changes.
- Coroutines : do some code in the background.
### Data Layer
- Room Database : Using Entity, Dao and Database Annotations to create a well application to store your tasks and filter your only completed tasks.
